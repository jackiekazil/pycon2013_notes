## Machine Learning 101: General Concepts

### Supervised Learning
- both features and labels
- known set of training data
- unknown dataset 
- labeled data

### Unsupervised Learning
- has unlabled data 
- example: faces of data 
    - is this a the same person?

### Scikit-learn Estimators
- fit method
    - pass it the data that you are interested in training
- supervised estimators
    - predicted labels for new data
    - predict probabilistic data 
    - score - score the prediction
- unsupervised estimators
    - transform
    - fit_transform

### Diagrams -- Supervised/Unsupervised Learning Models
- Flow of supervised machine learning problem.
- Unsupervised diagram... 
    - has no labels
    - kind of wishie washie (in comparison to supervised data)
