# Notes: Clustering of Iris Data
- clustering is finding relations in the data -- things that are like each other

- Use an unsupervised algorithm to pull out the clusters

## K-means
- You specify the n-clusters in the data
- Then it established the centers of the clusters
- For each point in the data it determines which cluster is belongs into 
- Then is reassigned points, reassigned center, reassigns points, until it concludes

### Diagrams 
- Image in imgs
- K-means vs True labels
- K-means does well w/ cluster on the left, but it doesn't with the clusters on the right.

## Applications of clustering
- Building customer profiles for market analysis
- Grouping related web news (e.g. Google News) and web search results
- Grouping related stock quotes for investment portfolio management
- Can be used as a preprocessing step for recommender systems
- Can be used to build a code book of prototype samples for unsupervised feature extraction for supervised learning algorithms
